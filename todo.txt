
HIGH priority
- improve display performance if possible

MID priority
- more interesting graphical/visual appearances of ores
- Cursed Keys
- Treasure Chests
- Storage Building
- Quarries
- New mines with new ores (Hallowed Mine and more!)
	- Hallowed Mine
	- "New" Mine
	- Coastal Mine
	- Sweet Mine
	- Random "Rogue" Mine "Mystery Mine" (checkpoints disabled, cleared upon exit or death)
- Inventory display adds "s" to the names of plural stacks when applicable
- Make so lakes can reveal holes when drained?
- Running / stamina
- Update buttons/text to be on top of tint overlays
- New tree types
	- Petrified Wood (handle boosts both mining and cutting speeds by 10%)
- ability to change player symbol

LOW priority
- Explosives have fuses
- Cracks can appear outside of bedrock in some mines (a crack can be destroyed with dynamite or creating a manual hole on a crack is 2x faster than usual)
- Potions (pushed to later game)
- Headlamps are fully fleshed out themes instead of just background change

Possible changes
- should forge items have different smelt times? currently only for tin due to low melting point
